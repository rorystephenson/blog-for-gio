title: The volcanic slopes of the West
---
Going down south from Alghero and crossing this steep slopes, nature feels so wild.
The varicolors cineritic land is submerged by the vegetation that doesn't leave any space. Only where ground became vertical, on the rocks wall, the plant do not take root and the sun can beat. Here, the coast is full of particular rocks formations, waterfalls and wild animals, as Grifoni (big birds like vultures), boars, foxes and others. These natural combo and the surranding sea, litterally makes you feel in the Jurassic.
