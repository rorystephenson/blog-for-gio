title: The right moment
---
Sometimes nature is magical. In the sense that it gives us a window of time, for a few hours or a maximum of days, in which elements such as the sea, the earth and the wind combine, expressing an incredible energy and creating shapes that border on perfection, like a smooth wave that rolls from side to side with precision. It is as if nature granted us its best side. \
In this photo the wave motion coming from the North / West a sandy rock encounter that has the right depth to allow the wave to break in this way; but not only that, the east wind makes the sea smooth, cleaning it from all the small ripples created by the past storm and keeping the wave straight until the last moment. the right amount of water on the bottom and the wind that keeps it straight allows the wave to coo, that is, it creates an eyelet of water (the most coveted place by every surfer) before breaking completely on itself. \
When sea and wind push in the opposite direction for a surfer it is time to get in the water.
