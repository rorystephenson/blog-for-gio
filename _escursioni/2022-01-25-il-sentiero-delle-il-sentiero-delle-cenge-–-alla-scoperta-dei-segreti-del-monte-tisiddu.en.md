title: The landscape of Nurra, hike to Mt. Forte
---
If you want to look out over one of the most exciting landscapes in Sardinia, this is the adventure for you.

The top of  *MONTE FORTE*  is the panoramic point par excellence of the  *Nurra* . In addition to being the highest mountain in this land, it is located in a strategic position, which allows you to see the entire North-West Sardinian coast at 360 °. From the island of  *Asinara*  to the north, the gaze descends along the coast passing through the mountains of the  *Argentiera* , hypnotizes itself on the  *Capo Caccia*  peninsula, and then turns away captured by the volcanic slopes that dominate  *Bosa*  and which they culminate towards the west with Capo  *Marrargiu* .
