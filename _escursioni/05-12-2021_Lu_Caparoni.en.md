The Capo Caccia peninsula , the Alghero's shield from the strong Mistral storms, together with Punta Giglio, delimits the large bay of Porto Conte. hike up to Torre della Peña, we will look out over its breathtaking cliffs and we could admire one of the highest cliffs in the Mediterranean, the Punta Cristallo wall, 326 m of pure dolomitic limestone overlooking the sea and integral reserve of the Porto Conte park . Here nests in niches and limestone vaults of the cliff, the peregrine falcon, the shearwater, the herring gull, the mountain swallow and the blue rock thrush. These are all species of great faunal importance and with spectacular flight, nests.

Walking on the irregular karst shapes that characterize this area can be difficult, but the sight of seabirds at sunset is something truly exciting.
