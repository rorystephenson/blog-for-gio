Kayaking is particularly ideal for venturing along the Sardinian North-West coast. This means of transport gives us the opportunity to explore every small and narrow corner of the cliff, which is impossible by boat. In addition, the kayaks that  *seakayaksardinia*  offers are ideal for traveling long distances at sea and therefore ideal for coastal exploration.

We work from two beaches in the Alghero region, one is in scenic Bay of Porto Conte, with it’s wildly beautiful coast teeming with marine life, and the other is Punta Negra Beach which is within a protected area ideal for when the sea gets choppy and with access to the southern end of the marine park.

Both of these coastlines are amazing, and we will visit some truly stunning beaches far from the touristic areas.

 **Half day (65 Euro / pers.)** includes coaching with an expert sea guide and the rental of kayaks and all the necessary equipment. \
 **Full day (90 euros / pers.)** in addition to the guide and the kayak, a packed lunch with fresh drinks and fruit will be offered.
